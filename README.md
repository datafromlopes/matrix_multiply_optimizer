# 🚀 Matrix Multiplication Optimization in C

This repository provides optimized implementations of matrix multiplication algorithms in C, leveraging advanced techniques to achieve high performance. 💻✨ We explore methods like blocking, vectorization, and loop reordering to maximize matrix multiplication efficiency.

## 🌟 Key Techniques

### 🔹 1. Blocking
Blocking divides matrices into smaller sub-blocks to improve memory access patterns. This reduces memory access latency and enhances cache utilization by minimizing cache misses. 📐💾

### 🔹 2. Vectorization
Vectorization uses SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions to enable parallel computations, boosting efficiency on compatible architectures. 🖥️⚡

### 🔹 3. Loop Reordering
Loop reordering adjusts loop iterations to optimize memory access, improving data locality and reducing cache misses. ♻️🔄

## 📂 Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the C source code with optimized algorithm implementations.
- `benchmarks/`: Includes scripts and test files to evaluate the performance of each optimization technique.
- `docs/`: Provides detailed documentation on the optimization techniques and performance results.

## 🛠️ Compilation Instructions

To compile the project, use a compiler like `gcc` with appropriate optimization flags for SIMD and other techniques:
```bash
gcc -O3 -march=native -o matrix_mul src/matrix_multiplication.c
